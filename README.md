## Installation
### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate SoundCloudSwift into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "gitdoapp/SoundCloudSwift"
```

### Cocoapods

You can also integrate SoundCloudSwift using CocoaPods. Just add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "SoundCloudSwift", :git => "https://github.com/gitdoapp/SoundCloudSwift.git"
```

And execute `pod install`. Remember to open the project using the file `.xcworkspace`
